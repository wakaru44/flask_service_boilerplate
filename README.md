# Flask Minimalistic Boilerplate

![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2017.svg)


Flask, Jinja2, Skeleton CSS, jQuery 2.

Minimal, with just a few add-ons: 

    flask-mongoengine
    Flask
    Jinja2
    MarkupSafe
    Flask-Script
    Flask-WTF
    flask-csrf

Enough to build a quick dead-simple api, or a dummy webserver.

Start by putting stuff in /app

# TODO

list of pending changes:

- maybe add a makefile to ease stuff?
